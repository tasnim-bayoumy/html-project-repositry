<h1> What is motherboard?</h1>
<p><big>A<b><u><i> motherboard</i></u></b> provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. <br><br>
There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.<br><br>

Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory,<br>
 so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.</big></p>
